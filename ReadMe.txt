The map will not currently work as it does not have a Mapbox API key or style link. You'll have to get these your self.

When you have the Mapbox codes, insert them in public/static/scripts/map.js and uncomment the code at the top.

To run the app, first you need Node.js installed on your computer. Then you open the folder and type 'npm install'. Then finally once that has installed, type 'nodemon' and the server will start. You can make changes to the code while the server is running with out restarting it.

If you have any other questions, please ask me (Aidan) or Austin
